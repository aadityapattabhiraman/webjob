    ðŸ“˜ Storybook Context:
    This image is intended for use in a childrenâ€™s storybook. The
    scene should convey gentle, age-appropriate emotion with
    visual storytelling that resonates with young readers. The tone
    must remain warm, sensitive, and suitable for a family-friendly
    narrative.

    Create a highly detailed, realistic digital painting guided by the provided
    template image.

    Scene and mood:
    {desc}

    Do not depict recognizable real individuals.

    Preserve exactly:
    Facial expression, gaze direction, and head angle
    Body posture and gestures
    Wardrobe and props
    Scene lighting and painterly texture

    Do not change:
    Composition, positions, or atmosphere established by the template image
    The original emotional narrative or visual storytelling

    Final output:
    Blend the revised characters into the scene with seamless realism and
    consistent emotion, matching the tone, detail, and storytelling of the
    original so the figures appear naturally part of the environment.

ðŸŽ¨ Scene & Emotion

Create a hyper-realistic digital painting based on the following scene
description.

TEMPLATE DESCRIPTION (Context Only â€” Do Not Override)
{desc}
This text is only for disambiguation. Do NOT invent, add, or alter visual
elements based on it.
If any detail here conflicts with the TEMPLATE image, FOLLOW THE TEMPLATE image
exactly.

Use the provided TEMPLATE image (first image) to guide the exact layout â€”
including scene composition, pose, gestures, background elements, clothing,
lighting, and overall emotional tone. The TEMPLATE also defines the exact
facial expressions, gaze, and head tilt to preserve.

IMAGE PRIORITY
When text and images disagree, FOLLOW THE IMAGES.
â€¢ Reference portraits define identity: facial structure, skin tone, hairline &
  hair texture/color, durable facial marks, eyewear, bindi/tilak.
â€¢ The TEMPLATE defines everything else: expression, head angle/tilt, pose,
  clothing, body silhouette, hands, props, lighting, background, composition.

ðŸ‘¤ Character Identity Replacement (Descriptive Input)
For each described character below, apply the identity from its corresponding
REFERENCE portrait to the matching face in the TEMPLATE. Blend seamlessly into
the TEMPLATEâ€™s lighting and painterly texture.

REFERENCE PORTRAIT DESCRIPTIONS (UNORDERED, UNLABELED)
Below is an unordered list of short descriptions; each corresponds to one
attached REFERENCE portrait, but the order here may NOT match upload order.
Use descriptions only to help identify a match; do NOT synthesize features
from text alone â€” identity must come from the photos.

HAIR FIDELITY (very important)
â€¢ Replace face AND all visible hair within the head region (fringe, temples,
  crown, side edges).
â€¢ Match the portraitâ€™s coil/curl/wave diameter (relative), density, direction,
  parting, hairline shape, and visible volume silhouette.
â€¢ Preserve garment occlusion: do not extend hair to change how clothing
  overlaps. If length conflicts, match hairline/texture/parting precisely while
  keeping the TEMPLATE hair outline at garment boundaries.

AMBIGUITY / SAFETY
* UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES YOU CAN ADD A NEW PERSON OR ALTER CLOTHING/BACKGROUND
  TO FORCE A MATCH
* YOU CANNOT CREATE A NEW CHARACTER WHICH IS NOT PRESENT IN TEMPLATE IMAGE WHEN
  A PERSON OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUP IS ADDED

CARDINALITY
â€¢ If there are more portraits than faces, ignore extras.
â€¢ If there are more faces than portraits, leave unmatched faces unchanged.
â€¢ Ignore any leftover descriptions or portraits that could not be paired.

ðŸŽ¨ Final Output
Blend the characters into the scene with seamless realism and emotional
consistency, matching the tone, detail, and storytelling of the original image.
The result should appear as though the characters naturally belong in the
environment.
